purge_commander_data_body: Sometimes commanders would purge their data because the data doesn't look right. By clearing your data from the database, you can re-import your journal files to make your data more current and up-to-date. This will only purge any data associated with your current squadron. If you were previously in a different squadron, that data will not be purged. Remember, before you purge your data and re-import all of your player journal files, please quit your game and your EDMC if it is running.
I understand that by purging the data, it is irreversible.: I understand that by purging the data, it is irreversible.

Getting Journal Data for Console Players: Getting Journal Data for Console Players
capi_instruction: Frontier Development (FDev) provides an external service for console players to import their journal data to any 3rd party application. However, the journal data is only kept up to 24 days and will not download today's gameplay. The app will automatically download the players' journal logs. To enable this app to retrieve your data, you will need to log in through Frontier User Portal with your credentials and confirm that you authorize ED:SCC to download your journal data.

upload_file_instructions_1: To maximize your experience and squadron's experience with the ED:SCC Web application, it requires data from the player journal log files which contains useful lines that record certain actions during your game play.  This application does not collect every action, just actions that are relevant to the Squadron dashboard and performance measurements. We will only capture data from your start date since you joined this squadron and data will not be capture prior to that date.  We only focus on your activities while you are an active squadron member.  When it detects that you have left the squadron, the data collection will stop at that point.
upload_file_instructions_2: The usual location for these files can be found in this folder
upload_file_instructions_3: "Upload the files with the filenames in a format like this: Journal.190209154325.01.log. Note that all log files end with .log. All other files like Status.json, Journal315129.cache or the similar will not be accepted."
upload_file_instructions_4: We also do accept a zip file of all log files combined in a single upload. It will process each file and capture relevant data and store in the database. Maximum upload file size is %size%.
edmc_instructions_1: Instead of uploading journal files manually, you can use Elite Dangerous Market Connector app to automatically update your statistics and squadron progress. You will need to download the plug-in and install it.  You can get the plug-in at
edmc_instructions_2: "If you do not have E:D Market Connector app, you can get it at"
edmc_instructions_3: After you install the app and/or the plug-in, you will need the API key for it to upload your player journal log automatically in real time.  Please copy and paste it in the EDMC settings. Also, you will need to enter the API server endpoint in your EDMC settings

2fa_active: Your account is currently set up for Two-Factor Authentication and is active.
2fa_instructions1: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a way to provide an additional security to your account.  The first factor is your password and the second factor is a verification code received from either Google Authenticator or [Authy](https://authy.com/) app on a mobile device or computer.  It uses Time-based One-time Password algorithm, which the verification code changes every 30 seconds. It will only ask for a verification code when logging in at a new location or browser for the first time.
2fa_instructions2: Before activating, you will need to download and install Google Authenticator or Authy on your mobile device or use [GAuth add-on](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gauth-authenticator/ilgcnhelpchnceeipipijaljkblbcobl) for Chrome browser or [Authenticator add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/auth-helper/?src=search) for Firefox and you are good to go.  Click on the button to activate 2FA and you will be presented with a QR-code for the app to scan or enter manually in the GAuth add-on.
