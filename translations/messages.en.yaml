purge_commander_data_body: Sometimes commanders would purge their data because the data doesn't look right. By clearing your data from the database, you can re-import your journal files to make your data more current and up-to-date. This will only purge any data associated with your current squadron. If you were previously in a different squadron, that data will not be purged. Remember, before you purge your data and re-import all of your player journal files, please quit your game and your EDMC if it is running.
I understand that by purging the data, it is irreversible.: I understand that by purging the data, it is irreversible.
